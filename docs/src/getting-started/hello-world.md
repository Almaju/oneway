# Hello, World

Create a file named `hello.ow`:

```oneway
main = (Stdout) -> Noop {
    "hello".print(Stdout)
}
```

Run it:

```sh
just run hello.ow
```

You should see:

```oneway
hello
```

That's the whole program. Let's walk through it.

## Line by Line

```oneway
main = (Stdout) -> Noop {
```

`main` is the program's entry point. Unlike every other function in Oneway,
`main` is **not** implemented on a type — it's a top-level binding.

The signature `(Stdout) -> Noop` says: this function takes one parameter
whose type is `Stdout`, and returns a value of type `Noop`.

- `Stdout` is a **capability**. Real-world capabilities only exist in
  `main`, which receives them and threads them down to anything that needs
  to perform a side effect.
- `Noop` is a singleton type — a type with exactly one value, named after
  itself. Returning `Noop` is the language's way of saying "this function
  produces nothing useful".

```oneway
    "hello".print(Stdout)
}
```

`"hello"` is sugar for `String("hello")`. The body of a function is a
sequence of expressions separated by newlines; the last one is the return
value.

`"hello".print(Stdout)` is a method call. The method is defined on
`String`:

```oneway
String.print = (Stdout) -> Noop {
    ...
}
```

`print` needs a `Stdout` capability because writing to standard output is a
side effect. A function that does not receive `Stdout` cannot print, and
the type signature is honest about that.

## Try Breaking Things

Some small experiments to build intuition:

- **Remove `Stdout` from `main`'s parameters.** The compiler will complain
  when `print` is called without it.
- **Add a comment** (`// hi`). The lexer rejects this — comments are not
  allowed.
- **Return something other than `Noop`.** The body's last expression must
  match the declared return type.
