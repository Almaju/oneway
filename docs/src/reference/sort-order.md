# Sort Order

The guiding rule: wherever ordering is discretionary, the compiler
enforces alphabetical order.

## Where It Applies

| Construct                              | Order                                       |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Components of a product type           | Alphabetical                                |
| Variants of a union type               | Alphabetical                                |
| Multiple methods on a type             | Alphabetical                                |
| Trait composition (`Show = A & B`)     | Alphabetical                                |
| Error union inside `Result<T, E>`      | Alphabetical                                |
| `use` statements at the top of a file  | Alphabetical                                |
| Arms of a `match`                      | Order of the union's variants (alphabetical) |

## Examples

A product type:

```oneway
User = Birthday & Username
```

A union type:

```oneway
Ord = Equal | Greater | Less
```

Multiple methods on the same type:

```oneway
User.add    = (...) -> ...
User.export = (...) -> ...
User.remove = (...) -> ...
```

Inline error union:

```oneway
File.read = (Path) -> Result<Bytes, IoError | NotFound | PermissionDenied> {
    ...
}
```

Match arms in variant order:

```oneway
match ord {
    Equal   => ...,
    Greater => ...,
    Less    => ...,
}
```

## Checking Without Compiling

```sh
just check path/to/file.ow
```

This runs only the sort-order check, with no codegen. Useful in pre-commit
hooks or as a quick lint while editing.

## Rationale

Ordering is a constant source of bikeshedding and diff noise. By forcing
one canonical order, code reads the same way no matter who wrote it, and
reordering is never a meaningful change.
