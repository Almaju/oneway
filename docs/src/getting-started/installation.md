# Installation

Oneway is distributed as source. You build the compiler with `cargo`, then
use it to compile `.ow` programs.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable) — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- **just** — a command runner. Install with `cargo install just` or your
  package manager.
- A working **C linker** (clang or gcc) — already present on most systems.

## Building the Compiler

Clone the repository and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Almaju/oneway
cd oneway
just build
```

This produces a debug binary at `target/debug/oneway`. The `justfile` at the
project root wraps the compiler in convenient recipes, so you rarely call
the binary directly.

## Verifying the Install

Run the bundled hello-world example:

```sh
just run examples/hello.ow
```

You should see:

```oneway
hello
```
